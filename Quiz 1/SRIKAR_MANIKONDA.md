# Hello! My name is Srikar Manikonda 

I am **undergrad student** at **UIUC** and I am **excited** to take this class!

## 3 fun facts about me:
* I like to play the guitar and make music in my free time
* I am left handed!
* My favorite show right now is probably Severance.

## My favorite programming languages:

| Programming Language | Why I Like It |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| TypeScript | A type-safe language that compiles to JavaScript, which is what I am most familiar with |
| Python | Easy to learn and super powerful |
| C++ | A little bit annoying to write, but performance is excellent |
